# Mutsumi Hata - Software Engineer Portfolio

## Overview

This is my personal **portfolio website**, built as a **static Next.js application** using the modern App Router architecture. It showcases my work, technical skills, and design sensibility as a **junior software engineer** focused on clean code, maintainability, and real-world functionality.

The site is designed with a hybrid styling approachâ€”leveraging **Tailwind CSS for layout and responsiveness**, while using **vanilla CSS and inline styles** where needed for full visual control (e.g., background textures, layering). The result is a cleaner, more elegant UI with fewer framework tradeoffs.

The site is deployed via **Netlify**, accessible at **[mutsumi.io](http://mutsumi.io)** (pending DNS finalization), and integrates directly with **GitHub**, **LinkedIn**, and a **functional contact form** via Email.js.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)**: Static site generation, route-based layouts
- **React**: Component-driven architecture
- **Tailwind CSS**: Layout, spacing, typography, and responsiveness
- **Inline styles**: Used intentionally for complex or fragile visuals (e.g. background image layering)
- **Email.js**: Enables contact form without exposing email address
- **Netlify**: Hosting, continuous deployment, custom domain support

---

## Features

- **Modular Component Architecture**: Pages, header, and footer split into clean, reusable files
- **White Brick Background**: Fixed aesthetic using inline style to bypass Tailwind's purge issues
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-friendly, accessible design
- **Project Highlights**: Direct links to real deployments and repositories
- **Live Contact Form**: Built with Email.js for direct outreach

## Design Philosophy

While Tailwind is powerful, it comes with limitations around dynamic class names, purge behavior, and visual layering. This project uses:

- **Tailwind for what it's best at**: layout, spacing, typography, responsiveness
- **Inline styles/CSS for precision**: backgrounds, blur overlays, and anything purge-prone

This hybrid approach ensures the cleanest possible visual result without over-engineering.
